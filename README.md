Description

## Starting

1. **Fork** this repo to your own github

- Clone your fork to your local machine.
- Make sure your Postgres database is running!
- `npm install`
- You can run `npm test` which will continuously run the test suite on file saves.
- To run the server and see the app, uncomment lines 20-22 in /server/app.js run `npm start`
- Read through the project structure. You'll be working exclusively in `server/unicorn.js`, `server/unicornApi.js`, `src/AllUnicorns`, and `src/UnicornCard` in that order.
- Start working through the tests in `test/`. You have to mark them as active (from pending) by changing `xit` to `it`
- `git commit` often as you make progress on the tests.

These tests include [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest).
